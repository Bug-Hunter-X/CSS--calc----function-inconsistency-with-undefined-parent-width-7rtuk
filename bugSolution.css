To fix this issue, ensure that the parent element has a defined width. This removes ambiguity and provides a consistent baseline for the `calc()` function to work correctly.

Here's an example:

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px; /* Or any other defined width */
}

div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```

By setting the width of the parent container (`.parent` in this case), the `calc()` function will now reliably calculate the width of the child `div` element relative to the parent's defined width.
