The following CSS rule causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```

This `calc()` function might not work as expected if the parent element does not have a defined width.  Some browsers may interpret `100%` relative to the viewport, while others may use the parent's content width or even the nearest ancestor with a defined width.
